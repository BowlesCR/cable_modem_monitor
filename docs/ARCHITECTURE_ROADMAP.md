## 📋 Issue Management Policy

**IMPORTANT:** When implementing fixes or features related to open issues:

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Close issues when pushing code changes
- Use language like "Fixed Issue #X" or "Closes #X" in commits
- Be overconfident that changes will work on user hardware
- Merge PRs that claim to "fix" issues without user testing

### ✅ DO:
- Keep issues open until users confirm success on their hardware
- Use softer language: "Attempt to fix", "Should address", "May resolve"
- Explain reasoning and logic behind changes
- Request user testing and feedback
- Add comprehensive tests to verify logic
- Document what was changed and why

### Commit Message Pattern:
```
Attempt to address Issue #X: [Brief description]

Changes:
- [Change 1 with reasoning]
- [Change 2 with reasoning]
- Added tests for [scenarios]

This should help with [problem], but requires user confirmation
before closing. See Issue #X for testing instructions.

Related to #X (remains open)
```

### Why This Matters

We don't have physical access to users' modems. What works in tests may not work on real hardware due to:
- Firmware variations
- ISP configurations
- Network conditions
- HTML/XML structure differences

**User confirmation is the only way to truly verify success.**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Core Design Goals

1. **Authentication is Protocol-Agnostic**
   - Auth layer doesn't know about modems
   - Handles only session establishment
   - Returns success status + optional response

2. **Modem Discovery is Independent**
   - Detection before authentication when possible
   - Non-authenticated endpoints tried first
   - Auth only when necessary

3. **Parsers are Declarative**
   - Parsers declare requirements (auth, endpoints, format)
   - Parsers don't implement authentication
   - Pure data transformation: HTML/XML → structured data

4. **Configuration is Data-Driven** (eventual goal)
   - Short term: Python dataclasses (type safety)
   - Long term: JSON files (community contributions)
   - Enables non-coders to add modems

5. **Extensibility Built-In**
   - Easy to add new auth types
   - Support for emerging protocols
   - Plugin-like architecture

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- JavaScript execution (modems requiring JS rendering)
- Automatic parser generation from traffic
- Real-time monitoring (stick with polling)
- Configuration through modem interfaces (read-only)

---

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

### Phase 4: JSON Configs (v4.0.0-alpha) - DEFERRED

**When:** Only when we have >10 parsers and clear community demand

**Goals:**
- Move modem configuration to JSON files
- Enable non-programmers to add modems
- Dynamic attribute support (extra_attributes)
- Validation schema with type safety

**Why Deferred:**
- Current Python approach works well
- Limited parsers (11 currently)
- No user requests for this feature
- Would add complexity without clear benefit

**Trigger Conditions:**
- 15+ modem parsers implemented
- Multiple community requests
- Users hitting limitations of Python parsers

### Phase 5: Community Platform (v4.0.0+) - DEFERRED

**When:** Only if JSON configs prove valuable

**Goals:**
- Visual config builder (CLI tool)
- Config submission workflow
- Community review process
- Parser marketplace

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires Phase 4 first
- Major infrastructure investment
- Current GitHub workflow adequate
- Focus on core functionality first

## 🔧 Parser Infrastructure Improvements

### Completed: Auto-Discovery (v3.x)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

Parsers are now **fully auto-discovered** at runtime. To add a new parser:

1. Create file: `parsers/[manufacturer]/[model].py`
2. Define class inheriting from `ModemParser`
3. Set required attributes: `name`, `manufacturer`, `models`
4. Implement: `can_parse()`, `login()`, `parse()`

**No registry updates needed!** The discovery system automatically:
- Finds parser classes in manufacturer subdirectories
- Registers them for modem detection
- Includes them in the config flow dropdown
- Sorts by manufacturer, then name

### Future: Manufacturer Base Classes

**Status:** 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Reduce code duplication by extracting shared parsing logic into manufacturer-specific base classes.

**Current State:**
- ARRIS SB6141 and SB6190 share ~150 lines of transposed table parsing
- Netgear CM600 and C3700 share ~200 lines of JavaScript regex parsing
- Motorola MB7621 properly inherits from MotorolaGenericParser (good example)

**Proposed Structure:**
```
ModemParser (abstract base)
├── ArrisGenericParser (shared transposed table parsing)
│   ├── ArrisSB6141Parser (just can_parse + metadata)
│   └── ArrisSB6190Parser (just can_parse + metadata)
├── NetgearGenericParser (shared JavaScript parsing)
│   ├── NetgearCM600Parser
│   └── NetgearC3700Parser
└── MotorolaGenericParser (already exists)
    └── MotorolaMB7621Parser (already works this way)
```

**Benefits:**
- New parser = 50-100 lines (vs 300-500 currently)
- Consistent behavior across models
- Easier testing
- Bug fixes apply to all models

### Future: Separate Fixtures Repository

**Status:** 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Create a separate repository (`cable_modem_fixtures`) to store HTML/JS fixtures from modems.

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner main repo (code vs test data separation)
- Easier community contributions (users submit fixtures, not code)
- Better privacy review process for user-submitted data
- Fixtures can version independently (modem firmware changes)
- Reusable by other projects

**Proposed Structure:**
```
cable_modem_fixtures/
├── modems/
│   ├── arris/
│   │   ├── sb6141/
│   │   │   ├── manifest.json    # Firmware, capture date, contributor
│   │   │   ├── signal.html
│   │   │   └── README.md
│   │   └── sb6190/
│   ├── netgear/
│   └── motorola/
├── schemas/
│   └── manifest.schema.json
└── tools/
    └── validate_fixtures.py
```

**Integration Options:**
- Git submodule (locked to specific version)
- Clone on setup (simple, always latest)
- Optional dependency (tests skip if not present)

### Future: Auto-Healing Parser System

**Status:** 📋 Vision

**Goal:** Automatically detect and recover when modem firmware changes break parsers.

**Concept:**
1. Store "expected" fixture hashes for each parser
2. Compare runtime HTML against known patterns
3. Detect structural changes (new fields, renamed pages, etc.)
4. Auto-capture diagnostics when mismatch detected
5. Open GitHub issue with captured data and diff

**Use Cases:**
- Manufacturer pushes firmware update
- ISP changes modem configuration
- Regional variations in modem pages

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Hash comparison of page structure (not content)
- Schema validation for parsed output
- Confidence scoring for parse results
- Automatic "needs attention" flagging

## 🎓 Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why No SNMP Support?

**Decision:** Web scraping only, no SNMP protocol support

**Rationale:**
- ISPs lock down SNMP on residential cable modems
- All similar projects use web scraping (none use SNMP successfully)
- Web interfaces are universally accessible
- See [License Analysis](./LICENSE_AND_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md#5-snmp-viability-assessment) for full analysis

### Why Defer JSON Configs?

**Decision:** Stick with Python parsers until clear need emerges

**Rationale:**
- Python parsers work well and are type-safe
- Only 11 parsers currently (low volume)
- No user requests for this feature
- Premature abstraction adds complexity
- Can add later without breaking changes

### Why HTML Capture vs Auto-Detection?

**Decision:** Manual HTML capture button, no automatic scraping

**Rationale:**
- Privacy concerns with automatic data collection
- User control over what's shared
- Sanitization can be verified by user
- Simpler implementation
- Respects user consent
